<p style="font-family:courier;">Comparative Assignment</p>
  
  <p>With Assault being one of the common violent crimes committed, some laws punish the offenders of this crime. In Florida's Justice system, when in an Aggravated Assault prosecution case, the state of Florida must identify whether the offender intended violence upon the victim, this requires evidence of felonious intent. This is true for many other cases where the offender engages in felonious acts that investigate intent as the first part of the case. In Florida, Aggravated Assault holds penalties of up to five years in prison/probation, a third-degree felony, and a five thousand dollar fine. Even first offenders of this crime are dealt with seriously in Florida as offenders will face the possibility of prison/jail time. In the case that a firearm is involved and discharged during an aggravated assault, a mandatory sentence of up to twenty years is included in Florida state law. Regarding Florida's Aggravated Assault laws, a deadly weapon is a weapon used to attack or threaten a victim that can harm or kill them, in Florida the definition of a deadly weapon is extensive. Some real examples of this would be an offender driving their car at a police officer as if to hit their car (Bryan v. State, 865 So. 2d 677 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004), or threatening a person sitting in their car with the windows up with a knife (King v. State, 12 So. 3d 1271 (Fla. 5th DCA 2009).

<p>	Next, compared to New Hampshire laws and accompanying punishment for aggravated assault there are some differences and similarities between how each state handles these cases. In New Hampshire, an aggravated assault case can hold many penalties based on the New Hampshire law. These punishments include a prison sentence of up to seven years, this is up to two more years more than the penalty for Florida at five years. New Hampshire also includes a possible felony, a permanent misdemeanor on your record, and fines exceeding a thousand dollars. These punishments are slightly less harsh as Florida charges you with a third-degree felony and up to five thousand dollars in fines. Next New Hampshire also includes courses such as anger management and sexual assault rehabilitation which Florida doesn't seem to offer. In the case that a firearm is involved and discharged during an aggravated assault, a mandatory sentence of up to twenty years is included in New Hampshire state law, same as in Florida when a deadly weapon is involved. Another similarity is that both states have extensive definitions regarding deadly weapons and both define the same weapons such as a knife or a car depending on the circumstances.

<p>	Arson is a crime where a person intentionally and unlawfully ignites a dwelling or structure with fire or an explosion and can have harsher punishment if the dwelling or structure was inhabited at the time of the crime. An arson crime in Florida takes place when a person sets fire to property intentionally without having a reason to do so. First, if you are charged with these crimes the court must prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was the intent. Although when it comes to arson in Florida it is not necessary to prove you had the intention of damaging property. Although arson is considered a property index crime it is very much considered a felony offense in Florida, arson also has first and second-degree elements to them as first degree means you knew the building/structure was inhabited at the time versus second degree which means you knew the building was empty and intended to set it on fire. Florida's statute of limitation for arson charges first degree is four years and second in three years both with a maximum fine of ten thousand dollars.
