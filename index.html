<p style="color:red;">Florida is a state located on the Southern East Coast of the United States and is a popular vacation spot for many United States citizens. With Florida being such a highly populated state it leaves a lot more room for crime, to evaluate Florida's Criminal Justice system comparison is needed to another state like New Hampshire. To assess and evaluate Florida's Criminal Justice system compared to New Hampshire, there must be a comparison between the rates for all four violent index crimes like Murder, Rape, Robbery, and Assault as well as the four property index crimes like Burglary, Larceny, Motor Vehicle Theft, and Arson. Next, there will be an assessment of each state's laws concerning Homicides and Burglaries to compare Florida's Criminal Justice System to New Hampshire's. Lastly, while diving into each state's Criminal Justice system there must also be a focus on the statistics that the Florida State and New Hampshire State police can offer to compare like each state's number of police-involved shootings, and exonerations between the two states. </p>

<p style="color:red;"> Florida and New Hampshire are two states in the United States on the East coast, with Florida being far South and New Hampshire far North. With these states being so different there are many comparisons between the two involving their Criminal Justice Systems. With Data provided by flhealthcharts.org, in the last six years (2014-2020), Florida had a peak age-adjusted Violent Crime count of ninety-three thousand and four hundred and five people, whereas in New Hampshire there was a peak age-adjusted Violent Crime count of two thousand six hundred and ninety-two out of one hundred thousand people. The peak year for Florida was 2015, and for New Hampshire, it was also 2015. Overall the Data provided above can help illustrate how Florida has a higher Violent Crime rate than New Hampshire. These rates can depend on how each State's Criminal Justice system may differ and how they may be similar to prevent a higher rate of Homicides.

<p style="color:red;"> To look at the nature and extent of crime and victimization there must be a comparison between Florida and New Hampshire statistics regarding the four violent index crimes; Murder, Rape, Robbery, and Assault. With Data provided by the Center for Disease Control, in the last six years (2014-2020), Florida had a peak homicide rate of Seven point eight per one hundred thousand people, whereas in New Hampshire there was a peak homicide rate of two points eight per one hundred thousand. The peak year for Florida was 2020, and for New Hampshire, it was 2019. Overall the Data provided above by the CDC can help illustrate how Florida has a higher rate of Homicides than New Hampshire by five. These rates can depend on how each State's Criminal Justice system may differ and how they may be similar to prevent a higher rate of Homicides. Moving on to the second violent index crime, it is seen through data provided by flhealthcharts.gov, that in the last 6 years ( 2014-2020), Florida had a peak Rape rate of eight thousand four hundred and thirty-nine per one hundred thousand people. Compared to New Hampshire, data found from macrotrends.net (2012-2018) there was a peak rape rate of fifty-eight point eighty-two per one hundred thousand people. The peak year for Florida was 2019, and for New Hampshire, it was 2013. The data provided for Florida was from 2014-2020 compared to the data found for New Hampshire was from 2012 only up to 2018, with this a comparison was still made between each state with each peak year remaining the same after factoring in the different years' gaps by comparing Florida's rates in 2012-13 to New Hampshire's. 
</p>
<p>Next, there is the third index crime, Robbery or Burglary as there seemed to be no definition between the two statistics. With Data provided by 247wallst.com, Florida had a Burglary rate of two hundred and ninety-five per one hundred thousand people in 2019 which was noted as being the twenty-first lowest state compared to an estimated three hundred and forty-one break-ins per 1one hundred thousand people nationwide. Compare this to New Hampshire with data from 247wallst.com, there was a peak Burglary rate of twenty-three per one hundred thousand people, leaving New Hampshire standing as the eighth lowest robbery state amongst all. Lastly, with Assault being one of the most common violent crimes committed, data provided by 247wallst.com illustrate Florida's Assault rate of two hundred and fifty-eight per one hundred thousand people in 2019 which puts Florida in the twenty-first spot compared to the rest. This is a little higher than the national rate which is twenty-five per one hundred thousand people. Compared to New Hampshire, with data provided by 247wallst.com, has an assault rate of eighty-four per one hundred thousand people making it the second lowest of all states. 
</p>

<p>	After looking at the four main violent index crimes and comparing Florida to New Hampshire there must also be a comparison between Florida and New Hampshire statistics regarding the four property index crimes; Larceny, Arson, Motor Vehicle Theft, and Burglary. First let's start with Larceny with data provided by flhealthcharts.gov, in the last six years (2014-2020), Florida had a peak Larceny rate of two thousand one hundred and seventy per one hundred thousand people. Compared to New Hampshire with data found from macrotrends.net, in the last six years (2012-2018) there was a peak rate of one thousand eight hundred and ninety-three per one hundred thousand. The peak year for Florida was 2014, and for New Hampshire, it was 2012. Moving on to the second property index crime, Arson, where data provided by CrimeGrade.org, shows that Florida has an Arson rate of one point six per one hundred thousand people during a “standard year”. Compared to New Hampshire where there was an Arson rate of two point seven per one hundred thousand residents. Florida is in the twenty-ninth percentile meaning twenty-nine percent of states are more dangerous compared to New Hampshire in the fifteenth percentile meaning fifteen percent of states are safer.

<p>Next, there is the third property index crime, Motor Vehicle Theft, in which data provided by flhealthcharts.gov, in the last six years (2014-2020), Florida had a peak Motor Vehicle Theft rate of two hundred twelve per one hundred thousand people. Compared to data presented within a 6-year period (2012-2018) from macrotrends.net, New Hampshire had a peak Motor Vehicle Theft rate of 80 per 100,000. The peak year for Florida was 2016, and for New Hampshire, it was 2012. The last of the four property index crimes is Burglary/robbery as there seemed to be no definition between the two statistics. Data provided by 247wallst.com, Florida had a Burglary rate of 295 per 100,00 people in 2019 which was noted as being the 21st lowest state compared to an estimated 341 break-ins per 100,000 people nationwide. Compared to New Hampshire with data from 247wallst.com, there was a peak Burglary rate of 23 per 100,000 leaving New Hampshire standing as the eighth lowest robbery state of all. 
</p>

<p>With Assault being one of the common violent crimes committed, some laws punish the offenders of this crime. In Florida's Justice system, when in an Aggravated Assault prosecution case, the state of Florida must identify whether the offender intended violence upon the victim, this requires evidence of felonious intent. This is true for many other cases where the offender engages in felonious acts that investigate intent as the first part of the case. In Florida, Aggravated Assault holds penalties of up to five years in prison/probation, a third-degree felony, and a five thousand dollar fine. Even first offenders of this crime are dealt with seriously in Florida as offenders will face the possibility of prison/jail time. In the case that a firearm is involved and discharged during an aggravated assault, a mandatory sentence of up to twenty years is included in Florida state law. Regarding Florida's Aggravated Assault laws, a deadly weapon is a weapon used to attack or threaten a victim that can harm or kill them, in Florida the definition of a deadly weapon is extensive. Some real examples of this would be an offender driving their car at a police officer as if to hit their car (Bryan v. State, 865 So. 2d 677 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004), or threatening a person sitting in their car with the windows up with a knife (King v. State, 12 So. 3d 1271 (Fla. 5th DCA 2009).

<p>	Next, compared to New Hampshire laws and accompanying punishment for aggravated assault there are some differences and similarities between how each state handles these cases. In New Hampshire, an aggravated assault case can hold many penalties based on the New Hampshire law. These punishments include a prison sentence of up to seven years, this is up to two more years more than the penalty for Florida at five years. New Hampshire also includes a possible felony, a permanent misdemeanor on your record, and fines exceeding a thousand dollars. These punishments are slightly less harsh as Florida charges you with a third-degree felony and up to five thousand dollars in fines. Next New Hampshire also includes courses such as anger management and sexual assault rehabilitation which Florida doesn't seem to offer. In the case that a firearm is involved and discharged during an aggravated assault, a mandatory sentence of up to twenty years is included in New Hampshire state law, same as in Florida when a deadly weapon is involved. Another similarity is that both states have extensive definitions regarding deadly weapons and both define the same weapons such as a knife or a car depending on the circumstances. 
</p>

<p>	Arson is a crime where a person intentionally and unlawfully ignites a dwelling or structure with fire or an explosion and can have harsher punishment if the dwelling or structure was inhabited at the time of the crime. An arson crime in Florida takes place when a person sets fire to property intentionally without having a reason to do so. First, if you are charged with these crimes the court must prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was the intent. Although when it comes to arson in Florida it is not necessary to prove you had the intention of damaging property. Although arson is considered a property index crime it is very much considered a felony offense in Florida, arson also has first and second-degree elements to them as first degree means you knew the building/structure was inhabited at the time versus second degree which means you knew the building was empty and intended to set it on fire. Florida's statute of limitation for arson charges first degree is four years and second in three years both with a maximum fine of ten thousand dollars.
