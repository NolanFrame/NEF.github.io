<p style="color:red;">Florida is a state located on the Southern East Coast of the United States and is a popular vacation spot for many United States citizens. With Florida being such a highly populated state it leaves a lot more room for crime, to evaluate Florida's Criminal Justice system comparison is needed to another state like New Hampshire. To assess and evaluate Florida's Criminal Justice system compared to New Hampshire, there must be a comparison between the rates for all four violent index crimes like Murder, Rape, Robbery, and Assault as well as the four property index crimes like Burglary, Larceny, Motor Vehicle Theft, and Arson. Next, there will be an assessment of each state's laws concerning Homicides and Burglaries to compare Florida's Criminal Justice System to New Hampshire's. Lastly, while diving into each state's Criminal Justice system there must also be a focus on the statistics that the Florida State and New Hampshire State police can offer to compare like each state's number of police-involved shootings, and exonerations between the two states. </p>

<p style="color:red;"> Florida and New Hampshire are two states in the United States on the East coast, with Florida being far South and New Hampshire far North. With these states being so different there are many comparisons between the two involving their Criminal Justice Systems. With Data provided by flhealthcharts.org, in the last six years (2014-2020), Florida had a peak age-adjusted Violent Crime count of ninety-three thousand and four hundred and five people, whereas in New Hampshire there was a peak age-adjusted Violent Crime count of two thousand six hundred and ninety-two out of one hundred thousand people. The peak year for Florida was 2015, and for New Hampshire, it was also 2015. Overall the Data provided above can help illustrate how Florida has a higher Violent Crime rate than New Hampshire. These rates can depend on how each State's Criminal Justice system may differ and how they may be similar to prevent a higher rate of Homicides.
